Cooperated with [Li](https://github.com/davit666), Robot Morphology evolved using Evolutionary Computation.

The physics simulator is implemented in VPython. Exactly 1m above a flat plane, a cube has been created by locating 8 spherical masses (balls) and by connecting 28 springs: 12 on edges, 12 on short diagonals, and 4 on long diagonals. Video demonstrations of the cube bouncing on a flat plane have been recorded and have been uploaded to links in YouTube. For observation, balls and spring cylinders are drawn with the radius of 0.01m and 0.002m. Two data structures have been developed for balls and springs, allowing them to store forces (F), accelerations (a), velocities (v), and positions (p) in 3D vectors. Global unit is in metric and setup coefficients are listed in table 1.
